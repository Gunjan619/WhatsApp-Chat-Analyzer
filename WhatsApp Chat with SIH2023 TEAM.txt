07/09/23, 16:23 - Abhijeth Pillai: Good evening everyone I welcome you to the team
07/09/23, 16:23 - Abhijeth Pillai: I have made this group particularly so that we can discuss ideas and plan for the project for the hackathon.
07/09/23, 16:23 - Abhijeth Pillai: For selection of the ideas I want input from you guys, So I want you to decide a topic/idea Think about it briefly, Note down the techstack of the idea So that it is easier to plan and execute and to differentiate the idea on the basis of difficulty also.
And then we can discuss the idea tomorrow when everyone is free. So everyone must be ready with At least one idea and you have to explain the idea to everyone in the meet.
07/09/23, 16:24 - Abhijeth Pillai: This will make it easier for us to decide the idea and to eliminate any doubts or confusion.
07/09/23, 16:24 - Abhijeth Pillai: You can visit the problem statements from the SIH website also or you can use any other medium to search the idea or bring up your own but remember one thing that if you are using any ai module to search for an idea then it could be used by anyone else also, So if you using an ai module try getting inspiration from it and then framing the idea yourself.
07/09/23, 16:25 - Abhijeth Pillai: https://www.sih.gov.in/sih2023PS
07/09/23, 16:25 - Abhijeth Pillai: In case of any doubt or query feel free to contact me.
07/09/23, 17:08 - Abhijeth Pillai: 1 more thing while selecting the idea keep in mind the following parameters:
07/09/23, 17:15 - Abhijeth Pillai: a) Monetizable: the idea should be easily monetizable and can be sold as a service or equipment easily
b) Problem solving: the idea should solve a major problem, or should solve a problem of a bigger audience.
c) innovative
d) tech stack: should not be too difficult
08/09/23, 13:53 - Abhijeth Pillai: Good afternoon guys
I hope you guys would be ready with your ideas.
So to discuss them we will hold a meet according to a time everyone feels comfortable.
